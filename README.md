**Blazing-fast individual tree segmentation from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds using Discrete Morse Theory with Bayesian refinement achieveing >0.85 Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).**

`TopTreeSegR` combines **Morse-Smale complex analysis** with **Bayesian boundary optimization** to achieve state-of-the-art tree segmentation accuracy. This R package delivers a production-ready pipeline that transforms raw points into clean, validated tree segments in under two minutes for a typical plot.

🎯 Core Features: >0.85 ARI | Single TTS_pipeline() | Bayesian refinement | Full validation suite | Interactive 3D viz

## 🏆 Key Achievement

**Proven >0.85 Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)** with the 2-pass Bayesian Boundary Refinement pipeline on benchmark TLS datasets.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github(c("DijoG/ahull3D", "DijoG/DiscreteMorseR", "DijoG/TopTreeSegR"))

# Install CRAN dependencies
install.packages(c("lidR", "dbscan", "FNN", "plotly")) 

# Load the package
library(TopTreeSegR)
```

### One-Line Pipeline (Recommended)
```r
# Read LAS file with ground truth
trees <- readLAS("your_forest.las")

# Complete pipeline: segmentation + Bayesian refinement
result <- TopTreeSegR::TTS_pipeline(
  las = trees,
  method = "morse-smale",     # Morse-Smale segmentation (recommended)
  input_truth = "pid"         # Las attribute of point ids
  cores = 20                  # Define number of threads
)

# Boom! You've got individual trees 🎉
print(result)  

# Visualize the topological segmentation
TopTreeSegR::plot_TTS_3d(result)

# Validate 
TopTreeSegR::validate_TTS(result, trees)
```
## ⚡ Performance

```r
# Complete pipeline benchmark
tictoc::tic()
result <- TTS_pipeline(trees_filtered, cores = 20)
tictoc::toc()
# 106.74 seconds (~1.8 minutes)

validate_TTS(result, trees_filtered)
```

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Complete Pipeline with 2-Pass Bayesian Boundary Refinement (BBR)

```r
# TTS_pipeline includes the first BBR pass
res <- TTS_pipeline(
  las = trees_filtered,
  method = "morse-smale",
  alpha = 0.1,
  stem_height = 0.5,
  prior_strength = 1.0,            # Spatial consistency
  likelihood_strength = 1.6,       # Elevation consistency (key!)
  confidence_threshold = 1.0,      # 1) Aggressive refinement (conf=1.0)
  cores = 20,
  fix_fragments = TRUE
)

validate_TTS(res, trees_filtered)  # Expect ~0.8408 ARI

# Second BBR pass
res2 <- TTS_BBR(
  res1,
  prior_strength = 1.0,
  likelihood_strength = 1.6,
  confidence_threshold = 1.9,      # 2) Conservative cleanup (conf=1.9), only very (> 0.9) probable improvements 
  cores = 20
) # ~10 seconds

validate_TTS(res2, trees_filtered) # Expect ~0.8502 ARI 
```

### Results
```r
# 2D projections
TopTreeSegR::plot_TTS_2d(res2, projection = "XY")  # Top-down view
TopTreeSegR::plot_TTS_2d(res2, projection = "XZ")  # Side view

# 3D interactive plot
TopTreeSegR::plot_TTS_3d(res2)
```

## 🔬 How It Works

`TopTreeSegR` uses Discrete Morse Theory to segment trees by analyzing the topological structure of the point cloud:

```text
🔄 1. Alpha-Complex Construction 
    - Convert discrete points to topological mesh
    - Simplify using alpha-shape filtration
    - Create combinatorial representation for Morse analysis

🎯 2. Morse Complex Computation
    - Compute discrete gradient vector field
    - Identify critical points (minima, maxima, saddles)
    - Tree trunks correspond to Morse minima (lowest points in each tree)

🌊 3. Morse-Smale Complex Analysis
    - Partition mesh into ascending/descending manifolds
    - Each minimum's ascending manifold = influence region of a tree
    - Points flow downhill to their corresponding trunk minimum

🔍 4. Seed Detection & Initial Segmentation
    - Cluster low minima near ground as tree trunks
    - Assign each point to the trunk whose ascending manifold it belongs to
    - Create initial tree segments based on gradient flow structure

🧠 5. Bayesian Boundary Refinement (Key Innovation!)
    - Identify boundary points between trees
    - Compute posterior probabilities using:
        • Prior: Neighborhood label consistency
        • Likelihood: Elevation coherence (Gaussian model)
    - Perform Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation
    - Fix boundary errors using elevation consistency

✅ 6. Post-Processing
    - Merge small fragments into neighboring trees
    - Ensure the connected component
    - Output clean individual tree segments
```
